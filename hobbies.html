  <h1>My favorite hobbies are:</h1>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Riding horses</strong></li> I grew up with horses, I love to saddle up with friends on a beautiful day or night and drink a few with the music going.
  <li><strong>Rock hunting</strong></li> I love to explore new places, especially a beautiful creek bed somewhere looking for awesome rocks or petrified wood.
  <li><strong>Fishing and crabbing</strong></li> I don't eat seafood but for some reason i <i>love</i> to go fishing and crabbing. Crabbing is especially my favorite because it is so exhilarating and satisfying to pull up your string and manage to catch beautiful blue crabs.
  <li><strong>Canoeing</strong></li> Canoeing is amazing. I love to paddle and coast along the creek beds, it can be incredibly relaxing or the perfect workout whether or not you want to take it easy.
  <li><strong>Swimming</strong></li> I just love to swim period. One of my favorite swimming holes is at Boykin Springs in Texas.
  <li><strong>Drawing</strong></li> I've been drawing since i was a kid. I don't do it so much anymore but I've always had a keen eye for detail and I can photocopy something with a pen or pencil.
  <li><strong>Reading</strong></li> I just love to read. I always was an accelerated reader and I can consume a novel a day in a single sitting. One of the worst things is to become "stuck" in the universe of an amazing series and you just feel kind of lost once your'e done. Reading is amazing.
  <li><strong>Camping</strong></li> I love to bring my horses camping. There is nothing like living besides your four legged partner. Having to cook on a fire, bathe in a creek, and sleep under the sky with your saddle as a pillow. It's incredibly fulfilling and liberating being able to live primitive and free, even if only for a little while at a time.
  <li><strong>Trail riding</strong></li> Trail riding is a culture and community I feel I was born for. Saddling up with an amazing company and meeting such awesome horses is honestly the best day ever.
  <li><strong>Riding four wheelers</strong></li> I love four wheelers. When not using mine for working purposes it's really fun to go mud riding or take a little ride on the fast trails.
  </ul>
