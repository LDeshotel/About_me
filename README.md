## Features
- This is Lauren Deshotel
- Hello! I wanna start out by saying I'm a single mom born and raised in the sticks, I have a 7 year old son who is the most amazing and feral little gignger boy you will ever meet. We both love food, drawing, and tv.
I'm an extremely hard working horse girl who also loves to ride fourwheelers, go canoeing, swimming, fishing and crabbing. I love to spend most of my time in the woods, or knee deep in a creek somewhere looking for petrified wood because I am a serious rock hound. I also love to build fires and drink a few on my weekends, literally just anything out doors.
